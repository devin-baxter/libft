# libft
Here is a fully working version of my first project at 42 Code School - Fremont, CA

I stongly advise that you use this ONLY as a reference guide. DO NOT COPY AND PASTE CODE DIRECTLY. If you want to use one of
the functions listed I suggest actually typing it out yourself.

To compile the libft.a library:
1) Place all "file_name.c" files into a single directory/folder
2) Ensure that some version of the Makefile is present in the directory as well
3) To create the "file_name.o" files as well as the libft.a library type "make all" into the command line/shell terminal
4) To remove the "file_name.o" files AFTER creating the libft.a library type "make all clean" into the command line
5) Typing "make all fclean" will compile the libft.a, remove the "file_name.o" files and then also remove libft.a

The Makefile and "libft.h" Header File are designed to have other useful functions added to to them as the user see fit.
Feel free to add any other basic functions to this list, but be careful about removing any since many functions rely on others
to operate correctly (or at all). Happy coding!
